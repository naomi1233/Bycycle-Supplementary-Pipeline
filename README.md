# Bycycle-Supplementary-Pipeline
a supplementary pipeline built for Cole &amp; Voytek's bycycle-tools/bycycle codebase, built for an undergraduate thesis at Dartmouth College's Thayer School of Engineering.
Pipeline can be used on any two groups with resting-state EEG recordings for purposes of group comparison and data visualization.
Data must be preprocessed through segmentation in the Matlab pipeline BEAPP, which can be found at https://github.com/lcnbeapp/beapp
